### 

**What is the purpose of this dashboard?**

This dashboard allows audiences to learn more about plants in danger all over the world and raises awareness of plant protection.

**The data**

This dashboard uses data from [TidyTuesday 2020-08-18](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-08-18). The original data set comes from [nternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list of Threatened Species (Version 2020-1)](https://www.iucnredlist.org/). The link to the data dictionary can be found on [TidyTuesday webpage](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-08-18).

This dataset is created by Haoxue Xiang.

Motivation & Audiences
=====================================

Column {.tabset}
-------------------------------------

### Background & Motivation

**What are the motivations of the data analysis?**

Just like animals, plants are going through an important biodiversity crisis. Many species from isolated areas are facing extinction due to human activities. In total, 500 plant species are considered extinct as of 2020. 19.6% of those were endemic to Madagascar, 12.8% to Hawaiian islands. Under this circumstance, I hope to show at least some parts of the critical situation through data analyses and visualizations in this dashboard and emphasize the extreme importance of plant conservation. Plant conservation and protecting the environment of earth are the responsibility of every human-being.  

### Target Audience

**Who are the potential audiences for the analysis?**

- Anyone who are interested in learning more about the critical situations of plants and hope to make some efforts in protecting plants
- Anyone who love plants, appreciate the beauty and uniqueness of plants, especially those rare endangered plants


The Data {data-icon="fa-database"}
===================================== 

Column {data-width=500}

### Description

This data set contains three tables: plants in danger in the world, threats to plants, and the actions. The plants table has 500 observations and 24 variables. The threats table has 6000 observations and 8 variables. The actions table has 3000 observations and 8 variable. The data dictionary can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-08-18). Parts of the data are showed in this page.

Analysis
=====================================

Column{.tabset}
-------------------------------------

### How did threat type of plants differ by continent in the world?

```{r}
threattype8 = threats %>% 
  filter(threatened ==1) %>% 
  group_by(threat_type) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(8)

threats %>% 
  filter(threatened ==1 & threat_type %in% threattype8$threat_type) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=fct_relevel(threat_type, "Unknown"))) + 
    geom_bar() +
    facet_wrap(.~continent, ncol=3) +
    labs(x='Count', y='Threat Type', title="Number of Top 8 Threat Types of Plants in Danger by Continents", subtitle="Africa had more plants in danger than other continents, \nwhere agriculture & aquaculture was the main threat type.", caption = 'The Bar Plot of Number of Threat Type by Continent') +
    theme(text=element_text(size=10,  family="Times"), plot.title=element_text(size=12, face='bold'))
```

### Which plant groups had the most threatening ways?

```{r}
plants %>% 
  select(group, threat_AA:threat_NA) %>% 
  mutate(threat_ways = reduce(select(.,-group), `+`)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=group, y=threat_ways, col=group)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(x='Taxonomic Group', y='Number of Threat Ways', title="Number of Threat Ways for Different Plant's Group", subtitle="Most plant groups have about two ways of threats. \nFlowering plants have 8 threat ways, which is the most", caption = 'The Box Plot of Threat Ways by Plant Groups') +
    theme(text=element_text(size=10,  family="Times"), plot.title=element_text(size=12, face='bold'))
```

### Which type of action was worst?

```{r}
actions %>% 
  filter(action_taken == 1) %>% 
  split(.$action_type) %>% 
  map_dfr(~sum(.$red_list_category == 'Extinct')) %>% 
  pivot_longer(`Education & Awareness`: Unknown, names_to = "action_type", values_to = 'num_of_extinct') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=action_type, y=num_of_extinct)) +
    geom_col() +
    labs(x='Action Type', y='Number of Extint Plants', title="Number of Extinct Plants by Action Type", subtitle="Except unkown action type, land and water protection is associated with the most extinct plants", caption = 'The Column Plot of Extinct Plants by Action Type') +
    theme(text=element_text(size=10,  family="Times"), plot.title=element_text(size=12, face='bold'), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```


Summary
=====================================

Column
-------------------------------------

### 

Based on the analysis and data visualizations, Africa has the most extinct or endangered plants. Agriculture and aquaculture is the most serious threat in Africa and lots of other places in the world. Flowering plants can have the most threatening ways and land & water protection seems to be the worst action type, which may explain why Agriculture and aquaculture is the most serious threat.
